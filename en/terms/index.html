<p>The Catchjobs application and website developed by CJS Bilisim Kariyer Danismanlik Anonim Sirketi (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Catchjobs&quot; or &quot;We&quot;), registered at Evliya Celebi Mahallesi Sadi Konuralp Caddesi Nejat Eczacibasi No: 5 Ic Kapi No: 2 Beyoglu Istanbul, is a video-based technological employment platform that brings together job seekers (&quot;Users&quot;) and employers (&quot;Employers&quot;) in the service sector both locally and globally.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Catchjobs website at <a href="www.catch.jobs">www.catch.jobs</a> (the &quot;Website&quot;), the services to be provided by Catchjobs, and the mobile application (the &quot;App&quot;) (collectively the &quot;Services&quot;), you are deemed to have read and accepted these Terms and Conditions of Use. If you do not accept these Terms and Conditions, please do not use or discontinue using the Services. These Terms and Conditions also form the user agreement between Catchjobs and you.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. CREATION AND USE OF YOUR USER ACCOUNT</h2>
<p><strong>1.1.</strong> The Services are free for job seekers (&quot;Users&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>1.2.</strong> After installing the App on your phone, you may start using the Services by accepting these Terms and Conditions. To create your Catchjobs user account, you will be asked to fill out the required registration form. For legal reasons, you must be over 16 years old to use the Services.</p>
<p><strong>1.3.</strong> You accept that all information you provide is always true, accurate, and up to date. You can update your information, your CV, and all your content at any time via the Profile section in the App or on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>1.4.</strong> After your account is created, you can browse the Services freely and view employer profiles.</p>
<p><strong>1.5.</strong> To apply for a specific job listing you are interested in, in addition to the traditional CV you create by filling out the form provided, you may be required to create a 45-second video (&quot;Video CV&quot;). In your Video CV, you can introduce yourself, share your plans, and showcase your skills. By uploading your Video CV, you accept that the receiving Employers will view your Video CV. You can create your Video CV in two ways: (i) by going to the Profile section and creating a permanent Video CV, or (ii) while viewing a job listing, by using the Video CV in your Profile section or by creating a new Video CV through the &quot;Apply&quot; section on the job listing page.</p>
<p><strong>1.6.</strong> Through the Profile section, you can block your current Employer or other Employers, preventing them from seeing your profile and learning that you are a Catchjobs user. You can also set your profile to &quot;Passive&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>1.7.</strong> You accept that Catchjobs does not and will not guarantee that you will be invited to a job interview or hired by Employers using the Service. Similarly, Catchjobs makes no commitment to Employers regarding the qualifications of job seekers.</p>
<p><strong>1.8.</strong> When you upload your Video CV and apply to a position, you accept that the Employer becomes the data controller of those data. How the Employer processes your personal data is not under Catchjobs&#39; control.</p>
<p><strong>1.9.</strong> You accept that you have obtained explicit consent from the relevant persons for any personal data of third parties you share with Employers or with us (such as personal data of people you provide as references).</p>
<p><strong>1.10.</strong> If you do not use your account for one year, we may deactivate your account. You can easily reactivate your account via the App/Website. If you do not use your profile to apply to a job listing for 6 months, the Video CV in your profile will be deleted.</p>
<hr>
