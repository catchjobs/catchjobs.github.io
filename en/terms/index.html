Conditions of Use</h1><p>The Catchjobs application and website developed by CJS Bilisim Kariyer Danismanlik Anonim Sirketi (hereinafter referred to as "Catchjobs" or "We"), registered at Evliya Celebi Mahallesi Sadi Konuralp Caddesi Nejat Eczacibasi No: 5 Ic Kapi No: 2 Beyoglu Istanbul, is a video-based technological employment platform that brings together job seekers ("Users") and employers ("Employers") in the service sector both locally and globally.</p><p>By accessing or using the Catchjobs website at <a href="www.catch.jobs">www.catch.jobs</a> (the "Website"), the services to be provided by Catchjobs, and the mobile application (the "App") (collectively the "Services"), you are deemed to have read and accepted these Terms and Conditions of Use.

CREATION AND USE OF YOUR USER ACCOUNT</h2><p><strong>1.1.</strong> The Services are free for job seekers ("Users").</p><p><strong>1.2.</strong> After installing the App on your phone, you may start using the Services by accepting these Terms and Conditions.

In your Video CV, you can introduce yourself, share your plans, and showcase your skills. By uploading your Video CV, you accept that the receiving Employers will view your Video CV. You can create your Video CV in two ways: (i) by going to the Profile section and creating a permanent Video CV, or (ii) while viewing a job listing, by using the Video CV in your Profile section or by creating a new Video CV through the "Apply" section on the job listing page.</p><p><strong>1.6.</strong> Through the Profile section, you can block your current Employer or other Employers, preventing them from seeing your profile and learning that you are a Catchjobs user. You can also set your profile to "Passive".</p><p><strong>1.7.</strong> You accept that Catchjobs does not and will not guarantee that you will be invited to a job interview or hired by Employers using the Service. Similarly, Catchjobs makes no commitment to Employers regarding the qualifications of job seekers.</p><p><strong>1.8.</strong> When you upload your Video CV and apply to a position, you accept that the Employer becomes the data controller of those data. How the Employer processes your personal data is not under Catchjobs' control.</p><p><strong>1.9.</strong> You accept that you have obtained explicit consent from the relevant persons for any personal data of third parties you share with Employers or with us (such as personal data of people you provide as references).</p><p><strong>1.10.</strong> If you do not use your account for one year, we may deactivate your account. You can easily reactivate your account via the App/Website. If you do not use your profile to apply to a job listing for 6 months, the Video CV in your profile will be deleted.</p><hr><h2>2. COMMON PROVISIONS ON USE</h2><p><strong>2.1.</strong> You accept that all responsibility for the content you upload belongs solely to you. When you upload content, you accept and declare that the content is not defamatory, insulting, hateful, biased and aggressive on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or otherwise, unlawfully threatening or harassing any individual, partnership, or company, or immoral, pornographic, obscene, or otherwise violating someone else's privacy, or reasonably considered to be so.</p><p><strong>2.2.</strong> You accept that we have the right to monitor all content and remove any content of the above nature, at our discretion or upon request of competent judicial authorities.</p><p><strong>2.3.</strong> You accept and declare that you will not store or otherwise collect information about others, and that the content you upload will not include unsolicited or unauthorized advertising materials, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes or other solicitations, or viruses, worms, spyware, ad-supported software, or other harmful programs and files. You may not send unsolicited emails or other commercial communications to Users or Employers on Catchjobs.</p><p><strong>2.4.</strong> You accept that you will not download and/or distribute any content belonging to others.</p><p><strong>2.5.</strong> Creating accounts using unauthorized methods, including but not limited to automatic devices, scripts, robots, spiders, crawlers, or scrapers, is prohibited.</p><p><strong>2.6.</strong> Violation of these Terms and Conditions may result in termination of your account at Catchjobs' sole discretion. If you violate these Terms and Conditions in letter or spirit or otherwise create potential legal risks for Catchjobs or others, we may suspend providing the Services to you in whole or in part.
